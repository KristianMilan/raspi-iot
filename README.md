# raspi-iot
A generic IOT platform for Raspberry Pi

This project aims to achieve:
* A service layer on top of a Linux OS
* Centralised, managed communications with a server
* Communications over a variety of means (wifi, ethernet, LoraWAN, Sigfox, semaphore, interpretive dance, etc...)
* Allowing control of multiple devices (input & output)
* Time-share for devices that are contended (e.g. wifi for comms and phone counting).
* Decent security
* Ease of use

It is a standardisation/consolidation of projects I have been developing for 5+ years in a variety of IoT contextx.
